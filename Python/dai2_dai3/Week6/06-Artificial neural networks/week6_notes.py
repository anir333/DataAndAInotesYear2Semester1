"""
- ANN (Artificial Neural Networks):
    1. Divided in the Input Layer, Hidden Layers and the Output Layer
        -> If it has more than 1 hidden layer -> Deep Learning

    - Integration Function:
        The weighted average + the bias
    - Activation Function:
        Produces the output pf the neuron.  -> Linear, Sigmoid, Relu, elu, etc.

- Training a Neural Network: Split dataset in Training, Validation and Test data
    1. Training data: Used to train the model
        - Typically 80-90% of the data
        - All classes a represented equally
    2. Validation Data: Used during training to check on how well the training is doing
        - Checks whether there is overfitting or not
        - Typically 5-10% of the data
    3. Test data: Used after training to evaluate how good the model is doing/was trained
        - Typically 5-10% of the data
